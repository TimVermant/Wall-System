# Wall System

## Intro

After being inspired on my group project, I decided to try and implement a basic building system on a tile grid with certain mechanics present in my wall system. This project has been mainly about implementing common gameplay mechanics and applying certain algorithms. 

## Mechanics

The building mechanic works fairly simple and uses a raycast to project and snap wall objects to a tile grid. When 2 walls get placed next to eachother they "connect" visually and logically. Once you surround a certain area with walls it becomes protected.
 

## Credits

Since camera movement wasn't the focus of this project, I used a simple camera movement script that I found online: https://gist.github.com/gunderson/d7f096bd07874f31671306318019d996
